FloatingActionButton
====================
Yet another library for drawing [Material Design promoted actions](http://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/promoted-actions.html).

This library supports API 4+.

Features
========
* Support for normal `56dp` and mini `40dp` buttons.

  ![Demo](screenshots/buttons.png)

* Customizable background colors for normal and pressed states and icon drawable.

* Convenience `AddFloatingActionButton` class with plus icon drawn in code.
* `FloatingActionsMenu` which can be expanded/collapsed to reveal multiple actions.

* Optional labels for buttons in `FloatingActionsMenu`.

Usage
=====
Just add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'net.i2p.android.ext:floatingactionbutton:1.10.1'
}
```

The library is available on Maven Central (`mavenCentral()` in your repositories list).

Alternatively, you can build it manually and install it in your local Maven repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/str4d/android-floating-action-button
cd android-floating-action-button
cd library
gradle installArchives
```

Then add `mavenLocal()` to the top of your repositories list (so it is checked first).

To see how the buttons are added to your xml layouts, check the sample project.

Caveats
=======
The API is **extremely** limited at the moment. It solves few select use cases in the app I'm working on.

Unlike some other FloatingActionButton libraries this library doesn't implement "quick return" pattern, i.e. hiding the button on scrolling down and showing it on scrolling up. That's intentional, I think that should be responsibility of another component, not the button itself.

Credits
=======
This library is a supported backwards-compatible version of the [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button) library by [Jerzy Chalupski](https://github.com/chalup).

That library used [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton) library by [Oleksandr Melnykov](https://github.com/makovkastar) as a base for development.
